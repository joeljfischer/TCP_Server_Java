# TCP Server - Java
## By: Joel Fischer

### Overview
This program was built at an intership with Advanced Systems and Controls as a basic server to allow communication between a PLC and a computer for testing purposes. At the time I was writing TCP code for PLCs and the commercial program I was using to test them was proving unreliable, so I built a simple TCP server in Java to help with development. It was my first foray into networked programming and GUI programming in Java.
